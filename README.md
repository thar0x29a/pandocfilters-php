This ist just a fork. I fixed the issues with the original quick and dirty and will not give any maintainance or support for it. Maybe I shall write my own version this days.


# PHP pandocfilters

This is a PHP port of the python module for writing pandoc filters found at
https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters

The purpose is simply to make it easier to write filters in PHP

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../pandocfilters.php';

Pandoc_Filter::toJSONFilter(function ($type, $value, $format, $meta) {
    if ('Str' == $type) {
        // use mb_convert_case instead of ucwords so filter works with unicode
        return mb_convert_case($value, MB_CASE_TITLE, "UTF-8");
    }
});

```

More examples and more information can be found in the original repository.
Dave Jarvis has opened a PR with a bit more information. Until it is merged it can be found here:

Thanks to John MacFarlane for pandoc.
